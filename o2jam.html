            <h1 class="blue">About O2JAM</h1>
            <div class="ddr">
                <p>O2Jam is an online rhythm video game for desktop computers, developed in South Korea by O2Media. The
                    earliest release of an O2Jam server on record is dated to February 21, 2005 ( source: Wikipedia.) I
                    just wanted to point out that it’s
                    a decently old VSRG and it is still being played by a handful of players today.</p>
                <p>
                    O2Jam is an example of a game in the VSRG (Vertical Scrolling Rhythm Game) genre. It is a rhythm
                    game where you have to hit the notes falling down (or up), which will appear according to the
                    music, as with every other rhythm game. Think of Guitar Hero
                    or Dance Dance Revolution. Every note corresponds to a music, so as you hit the notes, the actual
                    music notes will also be played!</p>
                <p>
                    O2Jam is a 7k game, and mostly focused on Long Notes. A 7k VSRG would mean that there are 7 columns
                    where the notes would fall down.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="ddr">
                <video src="video/mp4/O2Jam.mp4" autoplay muted loop class="vid"></video>
                <p class="blue"><b>An example O2Jam Gameplay</b></p>
                <p>In the playfield, you have the big Combo Meter in the middle, and the judgement just below it. On
                    the right of the playfield are the pills (which helps O2Jam players continue their combo) and the
                    HP gauge. There is the Jam gauge, which
                    is a big influence to the score just below it. </p>
                <p>Online O2Jam provides a good multiplayer environment. It is a good place to socialize with other
                    Rhythm Gamers too. You can compete with up to 8 players simultaneously, each games as intense as
                    the song provides.</p>
                <p>O2Jam is known to have a very lenient Judgement, which determines how accurate you have hit the
                    note. Compared to other Rhythm Games / VSRG’s such as <a href="iidx.html">Lunatic Rave 2 (LR2)</a>
                    or <a href="iidx.html">IIDX</a>, what is defined as a full accuracy play in O2Jam might
                    only translate as 75% accuracy in those games.</p>
                <p>Since O2Jam is an old game, expect an old-style interface. You can’t play O2Jam on window mode
                    without doing some nasty trick, but there is O2Mania which is an O2Jam emulator.</p>
                <p>If you would like to play and compete with others in real-time (and prefer long notes, which are
                    amazing), I would recommend you to play this game.</p>
                <p>Note that I said in the beginning, every note corresponds to a musical note. That is true for
                    official songs.</p>
                <p>At higher level gameplay, the notes does not correspond to a musical note most of the time. This is
                    because most of the high level songs are created by other players, who have no time to actually
                    compose the music for O2jam</p>
                <p>If you want to play songs that all have corresponding musical note per key, then there is another
                    VSRG called <a href="iidx.html">Lunatic Rave 2</a>, which is a Beatmania Simulator (BMS) for the
                    PC.</p>
                <p>Alright! I’m done with the necessary explanation, and that’s good and all, but how do you play this?
                    Where can you get this? How do you start playing?</p>
                <p>Since the official servers are down, you won’t be able to play it unless you go for private servers,
                    a server emulator (o2Emu), or o2mania.</p>
                <h1 class="blue">O2jam Gameplay</h1>
                <img class="omimg" src="images/jpg/o2jam_edit.jpg" alt="">
                <h2 class="bluee">1.Playfield</h2>
                <p>On the left side is where you will be mostly focusing on. Displayed there are the following:</p>

                <p><b class="bluee">Combo Count&nbsp;</b>- Your current combo. It says “1219” on the image.<br>
                    <b class="bluee">Judgement</b>&nbsp;– The accuracy of the note you just hit. It says “Cool” on the
                    image.
                    <br>
                    <b class="bluee">Jam Combo Count</b>&nbsp;– The current <b class="bluee">Jam</b>&nbsp;combo. It is
                    not shown on the image.<br>
                    <b class="bluee">HP Gauge</b>&nbsp;– Your current HP. Every <b class="bluee">Miss</b>&nbsp;and
                    <b class="bluee">Bad</b>&nbsp;will drain your <b class="bluee"> HP</b>. Losing <b class="bluee">HP</b>&nbsp;would
                    kill you (turning your avatar into a jelly-like creature), and instantly end the game (if you are
                    playing solo).<br>
                    <b class="bluee">Pills </b>- These helps the player from breaking a combo. Check under the <b class="bluee">Judgement</b>&nbsp;section
                    for more info.<br>
                    <b class="bluee">Jam Meter&nbsp;</b>- This is where most of your score comes from. Check under the
                    <b class="bluee">Judgement </b>section for more info.<br>
                    <b class="bluee">Score</b>&nbsp;– Your current score in the game. It says “530190” on the image.
                </p>
                <h1 class="bluee">2.Info Panel</h1>

                <img class="omimg" src="images/png/infopanel.png" alt="info">
                <p><b class="bluee">Title</b>&nbsp;– Title of the current song. It says “Necro Fantasy” on the image.<br>
                    <b class="bluee">Equalizer -</b>&nbsp;This is mostly for visual appeal only.<br>
                    <b class="bluee">Volume</b>&nbsp;– Volume of your O2Jam.<br>
                    <b class="bluee">Skill</b>&nbsp;– These shows the current <b class="bluee">Skill Rings</b>&nbsp;being
                    used in the game. The person is using the “Random” Skill ring in the image.<br>
                    <b class="bluee">Judgement and Combo Panel</b>&nbsp;– Every note hit is recorded here.<br>
                    <b class="bluee">Current Song Time&nbsp;</b>- Tells you how long the song has been playing. It says
                    “1:09″ on the image.<br>
                    <b class="bluee">Song Duration</b>&nbsp;– Tells you how far are you in the song. On the image, It
                    shows as a bar with the “o2jam”” on it.<br>
                    <b class="bluee">Difficulty and Speed</b>&nbsp;– This shows you what song difficulty you’re
                    currently playing, and the Scroll Speed. It says “HX4″, which stands for “Hard” diff and “X4″
                    Scroll speed.</p>
                <p>Take note that Scroll Speed only controls how fast the note goes down in the playfield, and not how
                    fast the music goes.</p>

                <h1 class="bluee">3. Judgement</h1>
                <p>Moving on with the rest of the info on the panel, there’s the game score on the right which displays
                    your “<b class="bluee">Max Combo</b> achieved, and the four judgements which tells you how accurate
                    you have hit the notes. Everytime
                    you hit a note, your <b class="bluee">Jam
                        Meter&nbsp;</b>slowly gets filled. Hitting an accuracy will fill up the <b class="bluee">Jam
                        Meter&nbsp;</b>faster.</p>

                <p><b class="bluee">Jam Meter </b>needs 25 <b class="bluee">Cools</b>&nbsp;or 50 <b class="bluee">Goods</b>&nbsp;to
                    be filled. Every time you fill a <b class="bluee">Jam Meter</b>, your score increases. The higher
                    the <b class="bluee">Jam Count</b>,
                    the higher the score increases. A <b class="bluee">Miss</b>&nbsp;or a <b class="bluee">Bad</b>&nbsp;will
                    deplete your <b class="bluee">Jam Meter</b>&nbsp;and<b class="bluee">&nbsp;</b>break your <b class="bluee">Jam
                        Combo</b>.</p>

                <img class="omimg big" src="images/png/cool.png" alt="cool">

                <p><b class="bluee">Cool</b> – This means you hit the note accurately.<br>
                    <b class="bluee">Good</b> – Not so accurate as <b class="bluee">Cool</b>.<br>
                    <b class="bluee">Miss</b> – Literally, the missed notes — the notes you were not able to hit.
                    Getting a miss will drain your hp by a certain amount, depending on the song difficulty.<br>
                    <b class="bluee">Bad</b> – Now this is a special judgement. Getting a Bad means that you
                    technically hit the note, but it was not on time. This drains far more hp than getting a miss. This
                    makes the player to think twice before hitting
                    randomly on songs that they can’t play. Thankfully, there are some way to turn Bads to Cool.</p>

                <img class="omimg small" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WBFLeHVbF-E/U6ulRB021LI/AAAAAAAAAFI/Uo-u7q7PxQg/s1600/o2jam_pills.jpg"
                    alt="pills">

                <p><b class="bluee">The Pills -</b>&nbsp;These could save your life in O2jam (literally!) by
                    transforming <b class="blue">Bads</b> to <b class="bluee">Cools</b>, at the cost of 1 pill per bad.
                    You can only have a maximum of 5 pills at a time,
                    and you don’t get to choose when to use it, so it still doesn’t exempt players from mashing their
                    keys. Throughout the song, you will regenerate pills by hitting 25 cools in a row, so you don’t
                    have to worry about when to panic or
                    not when notes suddenly come pouring down.</p>

                <h1 class="bluee">4. Skill Rings</h1>

                <p>These so called “<b class="bluee">Skills</b>” will allow you to change the way you play the game. On
                    this specific picture, I am using a “<b class="bluee">Random ring</b>” skill which randomizes the
                    note pattern in the song. There are
                    more <b class="bluee">Skill Rings</b>&nbsp;available, and you can put at most 2 <b class="bluee">Skill
                        Rings</b>&nbsp;of different type.</p>

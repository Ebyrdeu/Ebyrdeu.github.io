        <div class="ddr">
            <p>Lunatic Rave 2 (LR2) is more widely well known as a beatmania IIDX simulator, however, the dev of LR2 stated that it was not meant to be a BEMANI emulator. <b class="bluee">It should be considered a beatmania IIDX clone rather a simulator or emulator to be fully enjoyed.</b> To quote the manual, it says:</p>
            <blockquote class="bl">
                <p>This software is free.</p>
                <p>This software is not BEMANI emulator.</p>
                <p>Do not play any IIDX song.</p>
                <p>Do not make/upload/use IIDX skins.</p>

                </blockquote>
            <video src="video/mp4/Lunaticr.mp4" autoplay muted loop class="vid"></video>
            <p>With the amount of original content, and through the amazing Japanese community, LR2 has basically became its own game with rich original content and music. Unfortunately, it's a mess to get into and difficult to get starting, so newer players often download IIDX BMS and don't get to experience LR2 at its fullest, and how it should be played. This guide aims to help people set up LR2 to play the original overwhelming amount of content and set it up for the best experience.</p>

            <p>LR2 allows you to create an account where your progress is kept. It also allows you to set people as <b class="bluee">Rivals&nbsp;</b>and you can compete against their score. More on this will be explained on a post about LR2 Guide, which
                I will make soon.</p>

            <p>LR2 is mostly a 7k+1 game instead of 8k. The difference is that in 7+1, there are 7 main columns where the notes fall down and 1 special column which is usually reserved for certain beats or sound. You can think of 7k+1 as the regular 7k gameplay
                with the&nbsp;occasional +1 column sneaking in every now and then.
            </p>

            <p>In 8k, there are 8 main columns so regular gameplay would mean that all 8 columns would be used as evenly as possible.</p>

            <img src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/WavyAntiqueBluetickcoonhound-size_restricted.gif" class="omimg big" alt=" IIDX">

            <p>In the playfield, there are 8 columns where the notes can fall down. You have the Judgement placed on the playfield with the combo meter placed beside it, and the HP gauge (along with the Score) at the bottom of the playfield.</p>

            <p>Most LR2 players are pretty adept in non-LN (Long Notes) patterns, but most of them lack LN skills. Compared to&nbsp;<a href="o2jam.html">O2Jam</a>, LR2’s note style are not concentrated on LN. Also, because of the game’s hard
                <b class="bluee">Judgement, </b>most LR2 players are highly accurate players.</p>

            <p>One of the problem in LR2 is… it crashes a lot. After at least 5 songs, your LR2 would get buggy and you would have to restart the client. Luckily, crashes don’t happen often after 5 songs. Most of the time you would be able to play 20 to
                30 sounds before crashing, and that’s already a lot so don’t let it scare you.</p>

            <p>Although there are a handful of LN songs in LR2, it is not as mature as <a href="o2jam.html">O2Jam’s</a> LN. The same could be say the other way around. Although <a href="o2jam.html">O2Jam</a> has a handful of non-LN songs, they are not as mature as LR2.</p>

            <h4 class="blue">LR2HD</h4>
            <p>LR2HD is a hack/mod of LR2 which allows 1280x720 (or higher) skins. Nothing more, nothing less. It offers the same features and has the same bugs found in normal LR2. The game is also connected to the same internet ranking and such.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Go into your LR2beta3\LR2files\Config directory. Rename config.xml to config.xmh.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Drag and drop the downloaded contents into your LR2 folder. The same folder that has LR2.exe and LR2body.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Change your windowed resolution to 1280x720</p>
